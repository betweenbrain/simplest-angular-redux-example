For beginners like me to learn the concepts of [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)

Can it be simpler? Send a pull request.

To run this example:

1. `git clone https://github.com/webmatze/simplest-angular-redux-example.git`
2. From the repo folder run:  
   `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. open http://localhost:8000/ in the browser

And also head over to http://rackt.github.io/redux/ for some great documentation.

This was inspired by [simplest-redux-example](https://github.com/jackielii/simplest-redux-example).
